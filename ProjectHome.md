Jessie is a free implementation of the Java Secure Sockets Extension, the JSSE, a standard Java API for using the secure sockets layer (SSL) and transport layer security (TLS).

Jessie was the original free implementation of the JSSE, before the OpenJDK was released, and was included in recent releases of GNU Classpath and GCJ as the standard implementation of the JSSE. Now that the OpenJDK, and its JSSE, have been released as free software, development on Jessie will continue improving the code, adding more features, and generally tracking the state-of-the-art in TLS and its standard extensions.
